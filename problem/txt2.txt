Automated Synchronization (via AWS Lambda):

The primary mechanism for automated synchronization would be through AWS Lambda functions. These functions can be triggered in several ways:





Scheduled Triggers: You could set up Lambda functions to run on a schedule (e.g., daily, weekly) using Amazon EventBridge. These functions would then:





Connect to the Box and Smartsheet APIs to fetch the latest user data.



Compare this data against the current entries in your SharePoint lists.



Identify discrepancies (e.g., new users, updated departments, changed access status).



Either automatically update the SharePoint list with the latest information or flag the discrepancies for review.



Event-Driven Triggers: If Box or Smartsheet offer webhooks or event notifications, a Lambda function could be triggered in real-time whenever a user's data changes in those source systems. This would allow for near-instantaneous synchronization.



Bot-Initiated Synchronization & Responses:

The chatbot itself, powered by Amazon Lex, would act as an interface for both initiating synchronization tasks and querying synchronization status:





On-Demand Updates: An administrator could ask the bot, "Sync user X's data from Box to SharePoint," and the bot would trigger a Lambda function to perform that specific, immediate update.



Discrepancy Reporting: If the automated synchronization identifies issues, the bot could be configured to report these to an administrator. An admin could then ask, "Are there any data discrepancies in the 'Employee Directory' SharePoint list?" and the bot would provide a summary of identified issues.



Permission Checks: As you mentioned, the bot could also be used to query specific permissions. For example, "What files does N have permission to in Box?" or "What sheets does N hold in Smartsheet?" The Lambda function would fetch this information from the respective APIs and the bot would present it.

So, to directly answer your question, the synchronization can be largely automated through scheduled or event-driven AWS Lambda functions. The bot's role is to provide a conversational interface to initiate these automations, query their status, and retrieve specific information on demand, making the entire process more accessible and efficient.

Your current project, Connect Amazon Lex with Lambda, is directly building the foundation for this by teaching you how to link the conversational front-end (Amazon Lex) with the backend logic (AWS Lambda) that would perform these API calls and data manipulations.
