Set Up Multiple Slots in a Lex Chatbot: This project shows you how to expand your chatbot's capabilities to handle more complex interactions, like money transfers between accounts.

Build your first AI workflow: This project explores building an AI agent that schedules Google Calendar events through chat messages, showcasing how chatbots can automate tasks.

While not a chatbot, this project uses AI to scan code for security vulnerabilities, demonstrating another application of AI in automation and analysis.

On-Demand User Profile Retrieval: Administrators or authorized users can ask the bot for a specific user's details (e.g., "What is N's department in Smartsheet?" or "Does N have access to this Box folder?") and receive consolidated information.

Proposed Chatbot Solution: Cross-Platform User Profile Query & Verification Bot

We will implement a specialized chatbot, leveraging Amazon Lex for the conversational interface and AWS Lambda for backend logic, to serve as a centralized point for querying and verifying user information across Box, Smartsheet, and SharePoint. This bot will enable:

On-Demand User Data Retrieval for Lists: Administrators or authorized users can ask the bot for a specific user's details (e.g., "What is N's department in Smartsheet for the 'Employee Directory' SharePoint list?" or "Does N have an active Box account?") and receive consolidated, current information directly relevant to populating or verifying SharePoint list entries

Proactive Data Verification & Discrepancy Reporting: The bot can be configured to periodically (or on-demand) compare user attributes in Box and Smartsheet against your SharePoint lists, highlighting inconsistencies for review and correction. This moves from reactive firefighting to proactive data governance.

Targeted List Updates: When a SharePoint list requires specific user data, the bot, via Lambda, can fetch the most current information directly from Box or Smartsheet's APIs and present it for direct input or even automate the update process into the relevant SharePoint list, significantly reducing manual effort.


Impact: Automating this data harmonization frees up administrative time for higher-value tasks, ensures your SharePoint lists are reliable data sources for your Power Automate triggers, and strengthens your overall user management framework.

Yes, N, absolutely! That's precisely the power and flexibility we're aiming for with a well-designed chatbot. You can absolutely build a single bot to handle all those use cases and more.Think of each of those specific queries as different intents or as specific information you'd collect through slots within a broader intent.Here's how your "SharePoint List Data Harmonizer Bot" could handle those scenarios:* Getting user data from Box or Smartsheet and comparing it with SharePoint list access: This would likely be a core intent, perhaps something like "VerifyUserAccess." It would have slots for the user's name and the specific application (Box, Smartsheet, or SharePoint). Your AWS Lambda function would then call the APIs for Box, Smartsheet, and SharePoint to fetch the relevant access data and perform the comparison. * Seeing what kind of files they have permission to: This could be another intent, "QueryFilePermissions," with slots for the user's name and potentially the type of file or folder they're interested in. The Lambda function would then query the Box or Smartsheet API to retrieve that specific permission information. * Seeing what sheet they hold: Similarly, an intent like "QuerySheetHoldings" could be created. It would take the user's name via a slot, and your Lambda function would interact with the Smartsheet API to list the sheets that user has access to or owns.The key to making this work is the AWS Lambda function, which acts as the brain of your bot. It's responsible for taking the information gathered by Amazon Lex (through intents and slots), connecting to the external APIs of Box, Smartsheet, and SharePoint, processing that data, and then returning a concise answer to the user through the bot.Your current project, Connect Amazon Lex with Lambda, is laying the groundwork for exactly this kind of integration. You're learning how to link the conversational interface with the backend logic needed to fetch and manipulate data from external sources.Does that clarify 




Problem Statement: Inefficient and Inaccurate User Data Synchronization for SharePoint Lists

The manual process of populating and maintaining user information within SharePoint lists, drawing data from disparate sources like Box and Smartsheet, is creating significant operational friction and data integrity issues. This leads to:





Data Staleness and Inaccuracy: User attributes become outdated or inconsistent between Box, Smartsheet, and SharePoint lists, impacting reporting, access management, and automated workflows.



Excessive Manual Reconciliation: Administrators spend considerable time manually querying Box and Smartsheet to update SharePoint lists.



Delayed Information Availability: Manual updates cause a time lag, meaning SharePoint lists often don't reflect current user status, leading to delays and potentially incorrect decisions.

Proposed Solution: SharePoint List Data Harmonizer Bot

We discussed implementing a specialized chatbot, leveraging Amazon Lex for the conversational interface and AWS Lambda for backend logic. This bot would be specifically designed to query and update user information within your SharePoint lists by integrating with Box and Smartsheet. This bot would enable:





On-Demand User Data Retrieval for Lists: Authorized users could ask the bot for specific user details from Box or Smartsheet relevant to populating or verifying SharePoint list entries.



Proactive Data Verification & Discrepancy Reporting: The bot could compare user attributes across platforms against SharePoint lists, highlighting inconsistencies for correction.



Targeted List Updates: The bot, via Lambda, could fetch current information from Box or Smartsheet APIs and present it for input or automate updates into SharePoint lists.


We also clarified that a single bot can handle multiple use cases, such as getting user data from Box or Smartsheet, comparing it with SharePoint list access, and checking file permissions or sheet holdings. This is achieved by designing different intents or using slots within broader intents, with AWS Lambda handling the integration with external APIs.
